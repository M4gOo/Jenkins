Always need to think about backing up the jenkins server and some specific files/folders, restore policy, monitor the system, a system is only 
as good as how it can scale (example 2 jenkins servers and need to increase to 3).

backups -> avaible in full files/dir, snapshots
Good files to back up:
$JENKINS_HOME > config.xml  -> all configuration for Jenkins
              > jobs  -> all your CI/CDpipelines

There is not a specific solution to use - https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/backing-up/
  filesystem snapshots -> not a real backup, no recomment for long-term, better for daily
  plugins              -> it is a little bit more managed than one script -> ThinBackup (recommended)
  shell script         -> https://github.com/sue445/jenkins-backup-script
  
  
  Monitoring
  https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/monitoring/
  Recommended - Prometheus and Grafana
  prometheus plugin exposed on by default an endpoint /prometheus
    Ex.:http://localhost:8080/prometheus/
