the CI/CD pipeline runs via these build agents
Agents are systems the run the processes all the way throughout the pipeline
You have a task on your pipeline and that task says "go do this thing for me:, the build agents execute said thing.
Task executor (what are build agents) - is any system (raspberryPi, windows, linux, macos, docker, ...). Can have build agents that are 
running as Docker containers. For pre requisite the system must run Java

You can run Jenkin's workiload right from the Jenkins server, but it is not really recommended for security purposes, for performance concerns.



==================== Using an Ubuntu Server as a Build Agent ==================
Can use the same installation process when you install Jenkins

Add new brand new Jenkins agent
  - add new user on Jenkins server
    - sudo adduser <newuser>
    - sudo usermod -aG sudo <newuser>   (add user to the sudo/root group)
    - groups <newuser>  (check if the new user is inside the sudo group)
  - Jenkins dashboard  
      Dashboard > Manage Jenkins > Credentials > System > Global credentials (unrestricted)
      username - newuser
  - Jenkins dashboard
      Dashboard > Manage Jenkins > Nodes
      new node - put any name you want (Ex.: ubuntuagent)
      thick the box Permanent Agent - this is going to add this agent and give the ability to run any job that we want
  
  - Jenkins dashboard - create new item
      new item > freestyle project > ok
        thick the box Restrict where this project can be run 
            Label Expression - put the build agent name. Jenkins it will let you know if matches giving an output "label xxx matches 1 node"
        Build > execute shell > echo 'testing build agent'    
        Save > Build now
        
    
    ====================  Using Container Build Agents ===========================
    
Need to specify the agent (docker image) - >  docker { image 'golang:latest' }

pipeline {
    agent {
        docker { image 'golang:latest' }
    }
    
    stages {
        stage('Development') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/ybkuroki/go-webapp-sample.git'
                sh 'go version'
            }
             
        }
    }

}

 - Jenkins dashboard - create new item
      new item > pipeline > ok
      add the script above into the pipeline script > save > build now
