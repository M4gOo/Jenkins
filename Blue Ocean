Blue Ocean is not giving anything new from a functionality, better usability perspective, more straightforward
Idea is taking the old UI and making it new and improved 
  easier  to use
  better visualizations
  fast and intuitive pipeline status
  better pipeline editor
  personalization
  pinpoint precision - shows where in the pipeline intervention is needed
  integration for branch and pull requests
  
  
  ==================== Installing Blue Ocean ========================
  Not installed by default, can be install with a plugin
  It is part of the Jenkins
  
  - Jenkins dashboard > manage Jenkins > manage plugins > blue ocean
  
  To use BlueOcean
  http://localhost:8080/blue
  OR
  Jenkins UI > Open Blue Ocean on the left in Dashboard
  
  
  ======================= Creating a pipeline using Blue Ocean ===========================
  Create new pipeline > choose whatever you want (Ex.: Github) > choose your repository > give a name 
  Next step you dont need manually set up these Jenkinsfiles you can use the UI to do this
  Save
  
  if you select github, it will create a jenkinsfile for you in the repo you selected.
  
  
====================== Securing Jenkins ===============================================

User and access control 
      - Authentication (proof who you are)
              - Security Realm ( indicates who can access the Jenkins environment) , known as "authentication"
                  - Identity
                  - Membership
      - Authorization (permission to do something)
 
 Commmon Jenkins Security Mistake
 - anyone (even anonymous) can do anything
 
 
 ================= Managing and enabling security ============================================
 Dashoboard > Manage Jenkins > manage plugins > search for security  - there has some options you can implement from plugins perspective.
 extend some Authorization capabilities of Jenkins to support even more authorization schemes.
 Can be achieve installing Role-based Authorization plugin.
 For security Jenkins recommend some plugins
 
 Dashoboard > Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security
 
 
 Distributed builds - enable for protect Jenkins controller from maalicious build scripts
                    - builds should be executed on agent nodes and not in jenkins controller
  prevent builds from running on the Built-In Node
                    - Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes and Clouds > Executors 0 for the Built-In Node
                    
  Access Control for Builds
            - look for pipeline security, there are a lot options
            
 Security Pipeline Matrix 
  Dashoboard > Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security > under Authorization has the option Matrix-based security 
  then you can give different permissions for all users and groups
  
  There is another options which is per project which control based on a specific project
