Jenkins file - contains definitions (template, instructions). Tell a pipeline what it should be doing and what services and plugins
it should be interacting with
Multi-Stage Pipelines - we can put all deploys in a single file or separate. I the first stage fails, it will come back and no move forward.
So you need to fix to go further in a multi-stage single jenkinsfile.

To create a jenkinsfile.
VSCode write Jenkinfile 

===================== Sample Pipeline ============================


set up waht a pipeline typically looks like
In the Jenkins UI > + New item
SCM (Source Code Management - is used to track modifications to a source code repository)

Choose pipeline and press Ok
Discar old builds - it is not necessary to hold if you really need, usually keep for a few weeks
Do not allow concurrent builds - build wouldn't be able to run at the same time, usually your team are using, so you want to be able to build multiple times
Do not allow the pipeline to resume if the controller restarts - if the controller (Jenkins server) restarts, this is saying dont resume the pipelines that was running while the restart occurred
GitHub project - it allows you to puty in the project url
This project is parameterised - allow you to prompt users for one or more inputs. If you have to pass in a variable  this is a good way to do that
Throttle builds - this is good if you have slow systems, or you are working on scaling out. It just slows down the workload, it will allows concurrent builds

in Pipeline Script choose Hello World (in the drop box)
and Save

Select Build Now
To change go to Configure, do the changes, Save and then Build Now

==================== Build a CI Pipeline ===========================

Ex.:

- First install the plug in necessary in Jenkins
 Manage Jenkins > Plugin Manager > Install Go 
Restart Jenkins

- Configure the pipeline 
GO111MODULE - means you can install the latest version of some code base from GitHub for example.
sh 'go test ./...' - means it looks at the current directory and all subdirectories and runs every test that's available
pipeline {
    agent any
    tools {
        go 'go-1.19'
    }

    environment {
        GO111MODULE='on'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // Get soe code from a GitHub repository
                git 'https://github.com/ybkuroki/go-webapp-sample'
                sh 'go test ./...'
            }
        }
    }
}

- Create Jenkin pipeline
create new item and paste the code above in Pipeline description

- Global configuration (Troubleshooting)
https://plugins.jenkins.io/golang/
important to add the go-1.19 in the global conf, just follow the link above.
the version it this repo is important to match, building in Jenkins gave me a error because I did go-1.17 and I had to update  to 1.19. 
This change had to be in global configuration and also the pipeline script.
